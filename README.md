# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose
This analysis is to employ different techniques to train and evaluated models with unbalanced classes to arrive at the best model for evaluating credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, different techniques need to be employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Numerous supervised machine learning models or algorithms have been built and evaluated to predict credit risk.
